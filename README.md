With Mountain View you create reusable components for your Rails frontend, while generating a living style guide.

_FAQ_: Does it generate it automatically? You bet!

#### Example Style Guide

Visit the **<a href="https://mountain-view.herokuapp.com/mountain_view/styleguide" target="_blank">living style guide demo!</a>**
(<a href="https://github.com/devnacho/mountain_view_demo" target="_blank">source repo</a>)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'mountain_view'

Then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Use the built-in generator to create a new component:

```
rails generate mountain_view:component header
```

This will create the following directory structure:

```
app/
  components/
    header/
      _header.html.erb
      header.css
      header.js
      header.yml
```

Keep in mind that you can also use `scss`, `coffeescript`, `haml`, or any other
preprocessors that your app is currently using.


### Component Example
You can write your own templates on erb, haml or any other templating language.
Same goes with stylesheets and javascripts. You can use scss, sass or
coffee-script as long as you have these preprocessors running on your app.

```erb
<!-- app/components/header/_header.html.erb -->
<div class="header">
  <h1>This is a header component with the title: <%= properties[:title] %></h1>
  <h3>And subtitle <%= properties[:subtitle] %></h3>
</div>
```

### Using components on your views
You can then call your components on any view by using the following
helper:

```erb
<%= render_component "header", title: "This is a title", subtitle: "And this is a subtitle" %>
```

### Assets
You can require all the components CSS and JS automatically by requiring `mountain_view` in your main JS and CSS files.

### Global Stylesheets
In case you want to add global stylesheets (e.g. colors.scss, fonts.scss, etc.) to your Mountain View components you can do it by calling them with an initializer

```ruby
#config/initializers/mountain_view.rb

MountainView.configure do |config|
  config.included_stylesheets = ["colors", "fonts"]
end

```

```
//= require mountain_view
```

## Automatically generated Style Guide
A style guide will be automatically generated. This style guide never falls behind and it reflects your components in their latest version.

#### Setting up the style guide
1) Add the following line to your `routes.rb` file.
```ruby
mount MountainView::Engine => "/mountain_view"
```
2) Create stubs for your components. These stubs will be the examples in the style guide.

E.g: `app/components/card/card.yml`
```yml
-
  :title: "Aspen Snowmass"
  :description: "Aspen Snowmass is a winter resort complex located in Pitkin County in western Colorado in the United States. Owned and operated by the Aspen Skiing Company it comprises four skiing/snowboarding areas on four adjacent mountains in the vicinity of the towns of Aspen and Snowmass Village."

  :data:
  -
    :title: "Elevation"
    :number: '7879ft'
  -
    :title: "Depth"
    :number: '71"'
-
  :title: "Sunset on the Mountain"
  :description: "Three major ranges of the Alps – the Northern Calcareous Alps, Central Alps, and Southern Calcareous Alps – run west to east through Austria. The Central Alps, which consist largely of a granite base, are the largest and highest ranges in Austria."
